# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
This project demonstrates a use case of an NFT collection whereby it gives access to the first address to the platfrom a whitelist to some of the collections. It only allows a specified number of addresses to be listed which can be modified in the deploy script.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
